For simplicity, set an environment variable pointing to the directory
containing the HST SNDATA_ADDONS (i.e. this dir):

For example, in (t)csh
setenv ADDONS ~/src/stardust/SNDATA_ADDONS

 or for bash/zsh

export ADDONS=~/src/stardust/SNDATA_ADDONS

The snsed_HSTSN.tgz tar ball includes a modified version of the Hsiao
Type Ia SN sed template "Hsiao07.extrap.dat" which has been
extrapolated down to 300 Angstroms and out to ~20000 angstroms.  The
tar ball also includes a "non1a" directory containing modified SNANA
templates for CC SNe.  These are the updated templates from Dan
Scolnic, based on the SNID spectral template library, but they have
also been extended to the IR and UV by S.R. (using snsedextend.py) in
order to accommodate the extreme rest wavelength range required for
simulating the F350LP band at high redshift and the F160W band at low
redshift.  These modified templates will overwrite the default CC
templates included in the official SNDATA_ROOT distribution, but the
snsed_HSTSN.tgz tar ball also includes a directory "non1a.ORIG" that 
has copies of all those original (unextrapolated) CC templates.

Unpack this into your SNDATA_ROOT like this:

 tar -xvzf $ADDONS/snsed_HSTSN.tgz -C $SNDATA_ROOT/snsed/

------------------------------------------------------------

The kcor_HST.tgz files has  kcor .input and .fits files for HST filters
used by CANDELS/CLASH.

Unpack it into your SNDATA_ROOT/kcor/HST directory :

 tar -xvzf $ADDONS/kcor_HST.tgz -C $SNDATA_ROOT/kcor/HST/

------------------------------------------------------------

The filters_HST_CANDELS.tgz file has HST filter transmission curves for 
all filters used in the CANDELS and CLASH SN surveys.

Unpack it into your SNDATA_ROOT/kcor/HST directory :

 tar -xvzf $ADDONS/filters_HST_CANDELS.tgz -C $SNDATA_ROOT/filters/HST/

------------------------------------------------------------

Two search efficiency files are needed:

 SEARCHEFF_PIPELINE_CANDELS.DAT
 SEARCHEFF_PIPELINE_LOGIC.DAT

These are in the searcheff_HSTSN.tgz tar ball.  Unpack it as:

 tar -xvzf $ADDONS/searcheff_HSTSN.tgz -C $SNDATA_ROOT/models/searcheff/

2013.04.18 SR:
The SALT2.Guy10_UV2IR model has been updated to include a 
sensible extrapolation beyond t=+50 days in the rest-frame.
Previously the simulated light curves would flat-line,
giving a constant magnitude for t_rest>50.  Now we get a
more realistic declining magnitude by way of a linear 
extrapolation from the final days defined for the model.

 tar -xvzf $ADDONS/SALT2.Guy10_UV2IR.v2.tgz -C $SNDATA_ROOT/models/SALT2/
